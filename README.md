Brainstorming:
Ranking website:
Users choose between 2 items of the same topic, then are prompted to choose between the previously chosen item and another item continuously until all items in that topic are exhausted
Display global rankings of the best items in that topic
People can share the “decision trees” they’ve created
Can only see global rankings if not subscribed, need to subscribe to contribute and share
Maybe: users can create their own ranking tournaments
Additional requirement: global rankings will update in real time
Alpha: Display basic “global” ranking functionality (possibly make it real-time), navigation to all the pages in the application (whether or not they exist), gameplay loop of choosing between images
Beta: set up databases and backend for sharing and global rankings, create an algorithm for serving images, start sharing functionality, deploy
Final: finish real-time functionality if not done, finish sharing functionality, authorization, subscription
